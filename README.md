# Virtual Telepresence Spybot with Gesture Control

## Overview
This project showcases a remotely operated spy robot designed for virtual telepresence, enhanced with gesture-based control using computer vision techniques. It enables users to control the robot's movements through hand gestures, offering a seamless and intuitive interface. The spybot features a real-time video streaming system to provide situational awareness in remote environments.

## Features
- **Gesture-Based Control**: Uses hand gesture recognition (via OpenCV and Mediapipe) to control robot movements like forward, backward, left, and right.  
- **Real-Time Telepresence**: Provides live video feed using a mounted camera for remote surveillance and monitoring.  
- **Wireless Communication**: Operates wirelessly through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth modules, allowing flexible movement and control from a distance.  
- **Embedded Systems Integration**: Combines Raspberry Pi/Arduino with motor driver circuits for responsive robot operation.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Can be paired with a graphical interface or terminal for enhanced usability.  
- **Surveillance Use Case**: Ideal for applications like search and rescue, hazardous area exploration, and remote monitoring.
